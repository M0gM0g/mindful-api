# Project Title

Mindful.

## App Description

Mindful is a full stack cognitive behavioral therapy application.
Wikipedia can describe it better than I can:

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psycho-social interventionthat is the most widely used evidence-based practice aimed at improving mental health. Guided by empirical research, CBT focuses on the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems and changing unhelpful patterns in cognitions. (e.g. thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes), behaviors, and emotional regulation. It was originally designed to treat depression, and is now used for a number of mental health conditions, for example anxiety.

It's based on the book 'Feeling Good' by David Burns. Essentially,
the user will use this application to record their 'Automatic thought', then identify which 'Cognitive Distortion' that applies to it. Finally the user will provide a 'Rational Response' to the thought.

It's an idea I've been wanting to create as a tool for people that are looking for another way to combat stress, anxiety and depression. Mindufl is a simply, easy to understand way to wrap your brain around WHY you feel a certain way and how to find your way out. It's a great accompaniment for anyone looking to slow down and retrain their brain to think more clearly about situations.

## Planning

I started with creating the back end tables and tested them with curl scripts to
ensure that they worked. Once I had routes for the back end, I began creating the
front end. I tried to commit at least once a day.

## Future Additions

In the future I would like to add a date option to enter and sort. I would
also like to add more details and documentation on key vocabulary words
so the user has a better understanding of how to use the app.
